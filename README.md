# calc-centroid
Calculates the centroid of a triangle

Note that since any two unique, non-parallel, linear equations have exactly one intersection point, and since a triangle has exactly one centroid, the program only calculates the intersection of two medians, since the other has to intersect there as well.

Designed and tested for TI-84 Plus CE calculators, but probably compatible with many others.
